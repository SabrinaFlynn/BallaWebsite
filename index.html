                        <h4>The Balla Community</h4>
                        <p>Balla is a modern village which was originally developed around the site of a seventh century monastery founded by St Crónán.
                        The holy well that inspired St Crónán to found his monastic settlement and church has recently been restored along with a 17th Century building
                        that was used as a rest house for passing pilgrims.
                        </p>
                        <p>Balla has a thriving community dedicated to preserving, recording and promoting the history of the town.
                        </p>
                        <p>Their efforts have been noticed and they have recently won first place at the 'Pride of Place' awards</p>
